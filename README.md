# ThunderPack

<img src="./images/original_and_compact.jpg" alt="ThunderPack Board" width="550" />

A kick-ass microcontroller board with everything you need in a tiny package that fits in your pocket. Integrated battery & power management system, fast ARM microcontroller, USB bootloader, 4 high-power PWM outputs, 12 GPIOs, satisfying pushbutton switch, and more.

After years of wiring together portable LED controllers that all consisted of a lithum batter, charge controller, shitty slide power switch, and an arduino nano (or similar), I wanted something better. I always found those versions to be janky and fragile -- not to mention concerned that damaging the pouch cell battery might make it explode in my pocket! This board has everything I need with room to expand.

## Board & Pinout

### v1.2 Compact
The newest & smallest Thunderpack, measuring in at a minuscule 4cm x 1.9cm (1.6 x 0.75 inches)! The PWM pins on this model can each drive 1.4A to ground (common cathode).

### v1.2 Original
This is the original ThunderPack form factor and has the battery attached right to the circuit board. The PWM pins on this model can each drive 2.3A to ground (common cathode).
