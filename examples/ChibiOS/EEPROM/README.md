# EEPROM

ChibiOS doesn't have any functions to interface with on-board EEPROM memory, so this example shows how to include the [STM32Cube library](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/mcu-mpu-embedded-software/stm32-embedded-software/stm32cube-mcu-mpu-packages/stm32cubel0.html#overview) into a ChibiOS project and use the EEPROM functions from it. 

In this case we're using the driver files located in the [STM32Cube examples](../../STM32Cube/) directory. You can just as easily use files generated by the STM32CubeMX tool -- just remember to rename `stm32l0xx_hal_conf_template.h` to `stm32l0xx_hal_conf.h`.

When the program starts, one of the LEDs will light up. Pressing the button will light the next LED, and so on and so forth. When you turn the board off and on again, the previously lit LED will be remembered and be the starting LED.
